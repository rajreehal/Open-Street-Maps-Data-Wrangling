The OSM dataset I have chosen is of my current hometown, Toronto, Ontario. I chose this location because I'd like to learn more about my hometown and would like to teach others more about it. Also I hope to move on from my boring government job to start my carrer as a data scientist in this great city!

The dataset was exported as a metro extract from Mapzen:
